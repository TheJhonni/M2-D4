TEAM GENERATOR
Let's assume today is Friday and we want to split the class into teams to work together.

 

In this app you will generate teams and assign the participants to them.

 

You will use Bootstrap components and the grid system for speeding up the creation of the layout and elements of your app. Create a quick and basic layout with fake data to test alignment and positioning. Once you have the layout in place you can concentrate on the logical side with JavaScript. Create the layout quickly an roughly. No CSS required, use Bootstrap utility classes to style things.

 

Application Flow: 

 

1.insert names of people in a list → 2. insert number of teams needed → 3. generate as many teams (lists in columns) as specified in the input → 4. assign random people from the "waiting list" into a team.

 

Features:
Create an input to get the names to add to the list ("waiting list").
Create an input to get the number of teams the user wants to generate.
Create the grid for displaying the teams. Each team should be rendered inside of a column.
Make sure the previously specified number of teams gets generated before proceeding with the next step.
Create an “Assign” button near the “waiting list”. Every time the user clicks on it, a randomly picked name is placed in a team and removed from the list of people.
 

Extra Features:
Create a button to remove a person from a team, that also puts him/her back in the waiting list, to be reassigned.
Create a button that resets the state of the app.
